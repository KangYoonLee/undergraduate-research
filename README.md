## Abstract
Traffic prediction in Local Area Networks (LANs) is vital for efficient network management, enhancing user experience, and optimizing resource allocation. This research focuses on forecasting traffic patterns within multi-network environments, addressing the complexities of device-to-device communication across diverse interfaces such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Utilizing distributed Raspberry Pi nodes, we capture intricate traffic patterns and facilitate the sharing of prediction results among network nodes. We explore two primary approaches for traffic prediction: traditional statistics-based methods and machine learning-based models. While traditional methods, including moving averages and regression analysis, offer simplicity, they often fail to capture the dynamic nature of LAN traffic. In contrast, machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, provide greater flexibility and adaptability. These models leverage advanced algorithms to identify complex relationships and improve prediction accuracy. Our findings emphasize the advantages of machine learning approaches in accommodating the diverse and evolving nature of LAN traffic, enabling more informed decision-making in resource allocation and enhancing overall network performance.
